This repository contains my `.bashrc` and configs for various software:
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

To leave as a note - I am also using:

- [Trash-CLI](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli)

Apps to try: 
- fzf

## Installation
To use those best option would be just to make sym links into proper paths.

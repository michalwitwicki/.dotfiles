## Description
This repository contains my `.bashrc` and configs for various software:
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

To leave as a note I am also using:
- [fff](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff)
- [Trash-CLI](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli)

## Installation
To use those best option would be just to make sym links into proper paths.
